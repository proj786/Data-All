Variance and Standard Deviation having grade A

https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/9708-find-the-variance-and-the-standard-deviation-of-scores-that-have-grade-a?code_type=1



SQL :
with cte1 as (
select score , grade,avg(score) over () as mean_x
from  los_angeles_restaurant_health_inspections
where grade ='A')

select avg((score - mean_x) * (score - mean_x)) as variance,
      sqrt(avg((score - mean_x) * (score - mean_x))) as std
from cte1



Python :

# Import your libraries
import pandas as pd

# Start writing code

df = los_angeles_restaurant_health_inspections
df = df[df['grade']=='A']



df['mean_x'] = df['score'].mean()

df['var'] = ( df['score'] - df['mean_x']) * ( df['score'] - df['mean_x'])

df['variance'] = df['var'].mean()
df.drop_duplicates(subset=['variance'],inplace=True)
df['std'] = df['variance'] ** (1/2)
df = df[['variance','std']]
