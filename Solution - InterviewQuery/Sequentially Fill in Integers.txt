SQL:

with recursive cte_numbers as
(
    select int_numbers , 1 as counter from tbl_numbers
    union all
    select int_numbers,
           counter+1
    from cte_numbers
    where counter < int_numbers
)
select int_numbers as seq_numbers from cte_numbers
order by int_numbers



Python :

import pandas as pd

def sequentially_fill_in_integers(tbl_numbers: pd.DataFrame):
    l=[]
    for i in tbl_numbers['int_numbers']:
        for j in range(i):
            l.append(i)

    df=pd.DataFrame({'seq_numbers':l})
    return df
