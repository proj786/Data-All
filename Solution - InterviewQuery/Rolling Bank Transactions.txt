SQL :

with cte1 as (
select DATE_FORMAT(created_at,'%Y-%m-%d') as dt,
       sum(transaction_value) as amt
from bank_transactions
where transaction_value >0
group by 1
)
    select dt,
    avg(amt) over(order by dt rows between 2 preceding and current row) as rolling_three_day
    from cte1



Python:

import pandas as pd

def rolling_bank_transactions(bank_transactions: pd.DataFrame):
    df = bank_transactions[bank_transactions['transaction_value']>0]
    df ['dt'] =  pd.to_datetime(df['created_at']).dt.date

    df= df.groupby('dt').agg(amt= ('transaction_value','sum')).reset_index()

    df['rolling_three_day'] = df.rolling(window=3,min_periods=1).agg({'amt':'mean'})
    return df[['dt','rolling_three_day']]
